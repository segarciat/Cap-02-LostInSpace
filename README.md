#Lost In Space

A story turned console game originally developed by Michael Green, 
Scott Carpenter, and Hitesh Ahir. The GUI version was created by Sergio Garcia,
Uyen Nguyen, and Larry Wright. The game is based on a team navigating 
through space in the year 2352 when suddenly you've encountered an issue that
has impacted the mission. The team lands in an area where there is a deserted 
ship. The objective is to repair the spartan ship and safely return to your 
designated mission.
