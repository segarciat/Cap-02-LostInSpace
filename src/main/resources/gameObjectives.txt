You thumb the radio to open the crew chat.

"Captain! The Spartan is in bad shape! To leave safely, we will need to repair it!

 I am going to need some form of the following in order to complete the repairs:

   - A new power-coupling Engine COMPONENT. It doesn't have to be an exact match, but it must be compatible with our ship class, at least.

   - A welding TOOL capable of cutting through the hardened materials of our ship.
     She's meant for warp drive, after all.

   - A proper training MANUAL depicting the process using 3rd-party materials.
     I'm not psychic, ya know!

Once I have the necessary materials, I can have the jump drive ready for take-off in no time.

If you're not sure where to start, I'd head for ENGINEERING first.

We're counting on you, Captain!", you can hear the salute even over the short band.
